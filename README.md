# dilladesk

Derdillas configs for desktop. Checkout `install.sh` for installation.

## Principles

- Don't config for generic use cases. Config for concrete requriements.
- Avoid custom scripts, prefer existing tools from repositories
- Prefer lowercase names without special characters as they are easier to type (```regexp [a-z_\-0-9] ```)
